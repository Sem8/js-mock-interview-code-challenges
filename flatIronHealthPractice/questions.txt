1. recursion with array
2. Finding overlap between several sets of data  
3. Build an event consumer that takes in events and tracks data over time, returns different strings based on the events 
4. Given an array of arrays representing starting and destination currencies and exchange rates and an array of arrays 
representing starting and destination currencies, return the exchange rate between each starting and destination currency. 
You may have to convert between multiple currencies to make the exchange work. Maybe there's a better way to do it, but it 
seemed like a graph traversal problem to me. 
5. Djikra's algorithm
6. find words given a set of numbers on a T9 pad
