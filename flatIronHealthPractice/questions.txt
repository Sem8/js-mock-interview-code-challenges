4. Given an array of arrays representing starting and destination currencies and exchange rates and an array of arrays 
representing starting and destination currencies, return the exchange rate between each starting and destination currency. 
You may have to convert between multiple currencies to make the exchange work. Maybe there's a better way to do it, but it 
seemed like a graph traversal problem to me. 
5. Djikra's algorithm
6. find words given a set of numbers on a T9 pad  
7. implement a function that when given a 2D array of 1's and 0's returns the width, height, and starting points of a rectangle
 (being represented by 1's)
 8. Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is 
 formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by 
 water.

Example 1:

Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

9. Given a string of numbers, find all the valid T9 words that can be associated with them
eg: "28" -> ["AS", "AT", "AU"] or "223" -> ["ACE", "BAD", ...]

14. Given a hexagonal tile game, where there is a letter on each tile, write an algorithm to determine if a given word exists 
by traversing the graph without repeatedly visiting nodes - Senior software engineer interview
15. Merge integer ranges,  given [2, 5] [4, 8] [10, 12], return [2, 8] [10, 12] 
16. Given a string representing taken seats on a plane and a number N representing the rows on a plane, return the amount of 
seating arrangements for a family of 3. Seating between isles is not a possible arrangement. The seating columns are as follows:
