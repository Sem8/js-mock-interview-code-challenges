/*1. Phone interview - Sort the characters in string by  frequency and then by their alphabetical order. 
Example - bbaaccc -> cccaabb 

2. The question that screwed me - given array is [0,1,1,0,1,1,1] ; output should be [0,1,1,0,1,2,3] 
ie., for every non-zero element in array, find its distance to the nearest zero in O(n) time. i would definitely encourage the 
candidates who read this post to share their solution for this question. 

3. In order traversal of Binary search tree related (the solution is to start from right sub tree).
